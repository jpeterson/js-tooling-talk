Let's talk about how we develop JavaScript apps. Toss aside Notepad and IEâ€”it's time we got serious about this. 
Chrome Dev Tools, Postman, Grunt, Bower, SASS/Stylus, Sublime Text, JSHint... the list of tools grows every day. 
Once you learn to love your tools and get cozy with the command line, you'll be churning out apps faster than you can say "cross-browser compatibility."
